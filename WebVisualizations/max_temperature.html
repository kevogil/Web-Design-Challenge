<body>
    The closer we get to the equator, or a latitude nearing 0, the warmer temperatures we see.
    <br>
    We also see that latitudes on the southern hemisphere show a warmer temperature as we move away from the equator compared to the northern hemisphere.
    <br>
    This may be due to the fact that the southern hemisphere has more of bodies of water that are warmed up in the summer and retain heat throughout the seasons.
