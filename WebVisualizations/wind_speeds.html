<body>
    We see an even distribution of varying wind speeds across all latitudes.
    <br>
    Generally, wind speeds are found between 0 to 10mph.
    <br>
    We do see a few latitudes in the northern hemisphere with higher wind speeds, but not enough to draw a definite correlation between the two.
